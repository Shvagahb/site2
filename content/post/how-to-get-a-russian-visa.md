# How to get a Russian visa

First off, you cannot even get into Russia without a visa. <i>Not even for a day. </i> So let me ~enlighten~ you, on how to obtain a Russian visa while sharing my own personal experience.

There are <b>only</b> five Russian consulates in the United States. 5. Those being: Seattle, New York, San Fransisco, Washington, and _____. You can either travel to one of these consulates, or find a company to do it for you. You can get it in 3 days for $250 or 10 days for $160.

For most visas you will need:
Original HIV test from the prior 3 months
Invitation letter from a host (Hotel, friend, company, or work office)
The filled out online application form


Not wanting to spend the extra $100 on a company, found myself in San Fransisco at the Russian consulate asking questions.
